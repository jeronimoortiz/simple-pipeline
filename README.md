Hello everyone!

My goal for this project is to integrate some of my knowledge regarding DevOps related to IaC, CI/CD & Cloud.

The project consists of a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, it will run on an AWS EC2 instance (created with Terraform and provisioned with Ansible), for automated CI/CD on my portfolio
website.

Regarding directory structure, you will find a folder called 'Terraform' that contains the code to deploy all the infrastructure needed. Then, a folder called 'Ansible' which contains
all the roles and tasks to configure Jenkins on the EC2 instance deployed with the Terraform code. And, finally you will find the source code of my portfolio website.
